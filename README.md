### Hi there ðŸ‘‹
  Welcome to my github profile. I'm a Full Stack Developer, who's proficient in javascript, javascript libraries and javascript frameworks. I've been coding for a couple years as a hobby. Then I just rescently decided to make it a career.

- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on some projects to show off my frontend and backend skills. Like a factory production monitor, that 
      keeps track of parts made and a aproximate time when job will be done, based on cycle times of part production.
      
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning CORS and helmetjs. Also I'm starting on Java and php, so I have some flexibility.

- ðŸ‘¯ Iâ€™m looking to collaborate on a few apps. I don't know too many people that code. So it's hard to collaborate on projects, with other people.

- ðŸ¤” Iâ€™m looking for help with finding a job coding.

- ðŸ’¬ Ask me about my skills playing guitar. I'm good, really good. I'm the ninja turtle's worst enemy!

                              "You've heard it been said, by them of old, 'Love your neighbor and hate your enemy'. But I say
                     to you, love your enemies. Do good for them, that hate you. Bless those who curse you. And pray for those who
                   persicute you and use you despitefuly. So you may be like the children of your Father in Heaven. Because when he
                   causes the Sun to rise, it rises for the good and the wicked. And when he sends the rain, it rains on both the just 
                   and the unjust. If you only love those who love you, what reward is there for you? Don't bill collectors do the same?
                   And if you only say 'what's up' to your bros only, what more do you have than others? Aren't the bill collectors the same?
                   Therefor be perfect, even as your Father in Heaven is perfect."
