### Hi there ðŸ‘‹
  Welcome to my github profile. I'm a Full Stack Developer, who's proficient in javascript, javascript libraries and javascript frameworks. I've been coding for a couple years as a hobby. Then I just rescently decided to make it a career.

- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on some projects to show off my frontend and backend skills. Like a factory production monitor, that 
      keeps track of parts made and a aproximate time when job will be done, based on cycle times of part production.
      
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning CORS and helmetjs. Also I'm starting on Java and php, so I have some flexibility.

- ðŸ‘¯ Iâ€™m looking to collaborate on a few apps. I don't know too many people that code. So it's hard to collaborate on projects, with other people.

- ðŸ¤” Iâ€™m looking for help with finding a job coding.

- ðŸ’¬ Ask me about my skills playing guitar. I'm good, really good. I'm the ninja turtle's worst enemy!
